# Codecademy-Projects
The name says it all

A collection of projects I have completed while taking the Web Development course at Codecademy. 

I decided to keep them for two reasons.
1) To practice using Git
2) This is probably the main reason and that is so that I could reference back if I ever needed to

If you are reading this then you should check out my site https://www.mountaintopcoding.com where 
I have been putting all that I have been learning into practice in a real-world environment. 

Cheers.
